    "## Introduction\n",
    "Our physical world is filled with all sorts of data. Programming languages allow us to simplify and abstract that data so we can perform useful operations on them. For example, you could use Python's string handling capabilities to create a program which allows you to enter the titles of the books you own and then store that into a text file. For a more complicated example, you could create a list of the books you do not own yet, and then create a web crawler which searches across online book stores and alerts you to good deals. A lot is possible with Pythonâ€”if you first learn how to use its basic building blocks.\n",

    "Strings are sequences of characters. Some examples include: ```'ABCDEFGH#@!#(@UE'``` and ```'The cat in the hat'```. Like the previous examples, anything surrounded in single quotes is considered a string. We can also use double or even triple (three ' or three \") quotes. Furthermore, we can also embed single quotes within double quotes and vice-versa (this actually does come in handy).\n",

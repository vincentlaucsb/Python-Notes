    "# Boolean Statements\n",
    "## What is a Boolean statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "From Wikipedia:\n",
    "> In computer science, a Boolean expression is an expression in a programming language that produces a Boolean value when evaluated, i.e. one of true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean statements are named after George Boole, who thought of the idea of representing false statements as 0s, and true statements as 1s. This simple idea is now what underpins all of modern computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating Boolean Statements Directly\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can directly check the truth-value of a Boolean statement by directly executing it. Sometimes, it may also be useful to get the value of a Boolean statement using the function `bool()`. When creating Boolean statements, we can use **comparison operators** such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator | Result\n",
    "---------|--------\n",
    "x = y    | True if x is equal to y. False otherwise.\n",
    "x != y \t | True if x is not equal to y. False otherwise.\n",
    "x > y \t | True if x is greater than y. False otherwise.\n",
    "x >= y \t | True if x is greater than or equal to y. False otherwise.\n",
    "x < y \t | True if x is less than y. False otherwise.\n",
    "x <= y \t | True if x is less than or equal to y. False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are similar to the operators you've dealt with in every math class since algebra, so we will skimp a little on their explanation.\n",

    "## Why do Boolean statements matter?\n",
    "Often when programming we want to do one thing if a certain condition is true, but another thing is it is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate \"Boolean statements\" in our everyday lives as well. For example, before walking out the door, you might evaluate something like, \"If it there are zombies outside, I will grab my gun. Otherwise, I'll leave it home.\" This statement can be translated into Python-like pseudocode (fake non-functioning code which demonstrates a concept) like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``\n",
    "proposition = \"There are zombies\"\n",
    "if proposition is True:\n",
    "    get_weapon(\"rifle\")\n",
    "    get_weapon(\"flamethrower\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    do_nothing()\n",
    "    live_normally()\n",
    "``\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, the Boolean statement was the proposition \"there are zombies.\" This proposition has two values, **True** or **False**. The **if** branch of our program executes if the proposition is True. The **else** branch executes if it is False. Below, you will also see branches that begin with the word **elif** (else-if). These branches execute if the preceding if branches do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice the capitalization of **True** and **False**. This is because Python has these keywords reserved to refer to the potential values of Boolean statements. Anytime you want to refer to Boolean values, you should always use True or False capitalized in that way. Likewise, you should never use True or False as variable, function, etc. names."

    "## Another Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "If, else-if, and else statements allow us to create more complex and useful functions and programs in Python. When Python reads a script, it executes statements from top to bottom. Metaphorically speaking, we can say that a script *flows* a certain way (top to bottom). Likewise, we can think of a large group of people flowing into a facility that has a swimming pool. Furthermore, we can imagine it would be reasonable to divert this flow in certain ways. If a person is very young or otherwise lacks swimming ability, then we tell them to go to the shallow end of the pool. Otherwise, they have the option to go to the deep end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are evaluating a condition: a person's swimming ability. Based on our evaluation, we may choose one option or another. In Python, if, else, and else if statements allow us to make different choices based on conditionals as well.\n",
